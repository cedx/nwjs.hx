# Installation

## Requirements
Before installing **Haxe externs for NW.js**, you need to make sure you have [Haxe](https://haxe.org) up and running.
You can verify if you're already good to go with the following command:

```shell
haxe --version
# 4.2.3
```

## Installing with a package manager

### 1. Install it
From a command prompt, run:

```shell
# haxelib
haxelib install nwjs

# lix
lix +lib nwjs
```

### 2. Import it
Now in your [Haxe](https://haxe.org) code, you can use:

```haxe
import js.nw.*;
```
